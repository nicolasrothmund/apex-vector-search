# Sample Vector Search App (Personal Export)

**Copyright Notice:** Please note that all rights to this Application belong to Oracle Corporation. 
This repository contains only a personal export of this application from my free Oracle APEX trial environment. This export was performed after Oracle made the application publicly available.

**Background and Motivation:** During a five-month internship, I had the opportunity to actively participate in the development of this Sample Vector Search Application. 
This Sample Vector Search project serves to demonstrate the significant relevance and far-reaching potential of Vector Search technology.
The fact that this Application now serves as one of 22 Sample Applications in Oracle APEX for over 4 million existing APEX applications underscores its importance.

**Connection to the Financial Industry:** My academic work and further research in the field of Finance, with a particular focus on Private Equity and Venture Capital, have highlighted the immense possibilities of Vector Search technology in the financial sector. 
I am convinced that this technology is not limited to APEX but can revolutionize the entire search domain. 
The ability to efficiently find relevant market information and analyze unstructured data holds, in my view, enormous disruptive potential for the entire financial sector.
